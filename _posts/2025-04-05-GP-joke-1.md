GP: Doctor Gramacy, I feel down today. 
 
Dr. Gramacy: Any prior condition? 
 
GP: I see myself as quite normal...Constant mean, a stationary kernel. 
However, after I made a few negative observations, I felt dragged down. 
 
Dr. Gramacy: I see. All we need is to take you to a better place.  
 
GP: ow, that feels uncertain!
 
Dr. Gramacy: don't panic, we'll get there by little updates...See? 
 
GP: Wait...yes! Actually, I already feel much better now. 
 
Dr Gramacy: Very good! Anything else I can do for you? 
 
GP: Well, I am still hoping to really get on top of things...

Dr. Gramacy: let me recommend some extra observations via BO acquisition functions.
