I am heading the Chair of Statistical Data Science and serving as Director of Studies in Statistics at the [University of Bern](http://www.unibe.ch), where I am co-directing the [Institute of Mathematical Statistics and Actuarial Science](http://www.imsv.unibe.ch/index_eng.html).  My office (009) is located at Alpeneggstrasse 22, 3012 Bern, Switzerand. 

At the University of Bern, I am also a member of  
* the [Oeschger Center for Climate Change Research](http://www.oeschger.unibe.ch/),
* the [Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medecine](https://www.caim.unibe.ch/),
* and the [Multisdisciplinary Center for Infectious Diseases](https://www.mcid.unibe.ch/).

On the editorial side, I am serving as Associate Editor of
* [SIAM/ASA Journal on Uncertainty Quantification](https://www.siam.org/Publications/Journals/SIAM-ASA-Journal-on-Uncertainty-Quantification-JUQ),
* [Technometrics](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/utch20"),
  
and regularly as Area Chair / Meta-Reviewer for major Machine Learning conferences (e.g., [ICML 2023](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023), [AISTATS 2024](http://aistats.org/aistats2024/)).

A significant part of my research deals with random field (including in particular Gaussian Process) modelling and adaptive design 
of experiments, with a focus on Bayesian global optimization and related topics such as Bayesian set estimation. Further interests include design and estimation of covariance kernels and parameters,  as well as connections between Kriging and functional analysis approaches (notably the theory or Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces). 
From the real-world application side, I have been working with a number of colleagues both from engineering 
and from geosciences. In recent years, my team and I have started collaborations with climate scientists, 
and now also with colleagues from medecine.     
 
I defended my PhD in Applied Mathematics at the [Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne](http://www.mines-stetienne.fr/en/) in 2009. 
Previous to that, I obtained a double graduate diploma from Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne and [Berlin Technical University](http://www.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/) (2005), a research master's degree in Applied Mathematics jointly awarded by [Jean Monnet University](https://www.univ-st-etienne.fr/fr/index.html) and Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne (2005), and a licence in Mathematics from [Joseph Fourier University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier_University), Grenoble (2002).
 
From 2008/2009, I worked as an assistant and a scientific collaborator, respectively in the [Institute of Mathematics](https://www.unine.ch/math/home.html) and the [Centre for Hydrogeology and Geothermics](https://www.unine.ch/chyn) (Stochastic Hydrogeology Group headed by Philippe Renard), University of Neuchatel, before starting to work as Senior Assistant (2010) and then Dozent (2014) at the IMSV of the University of Bern.  

From September 2015 to May 2020, I worked mainly as a permanent senior researcher at [Idiap Research Institute](http://www.idiap.ch) where I founded and headed the Uncertainty Quantification and Optimal Design group. During my last two academic years at Idiap, I lectured at [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) 
and participated to the [Master in Artificial Intelligence](https://master-ai.ch/) offered by [Unidistance](https://distanceuniversity.ch/artificial-intelligence/master/) and Idiap. I have also held since 2018 a titular professorship at the University of Bern, where 
I have been employed in several settings between my habilitation in 2014 and my current employment (from August 2021) as a Professor Extraordinarius.
